# Advent of Code Solutions
This is my public repo of my solutions to (Advent of Code 2020)[https://adventofcode.com/2020.md].

I have commented past solutions out, and errors so that I can look back one day in the future and laugh at myself for writing such stupid things. 
There exists a couple of 1 liners in the code that I created, though not always good lol.

Thanks to Code Bullet and Co discord server for hosting a private leaderboard and giving me a place to talk to others about AoC!
